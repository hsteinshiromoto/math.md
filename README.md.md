# The Repository

## Zettelkasten

This repository is an adaptation of the Zettelkasten method for taking notes in mathematics and related fields of study. This method is based on a set of rules on how to collect and organize the notes.

1. Collect relevant references in the `Reference/`folder.
2. Write temporary notes in the `Fleeting/` folder.
3. Combine `Fleeting/` notes and `Reference/` folder into the `Literature/` folder to ellaborate on the ideas of the original author.
4. Create `Permanent/` notes based on all of the above. These are made to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
