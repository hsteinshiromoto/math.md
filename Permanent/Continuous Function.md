# Continuous Function

## Context

The definitions of continuity in terms of [[Metric Space|metric spaces]]

![[Metrical Continuous Function#Statements]]

and [[Topological Space|topological spaces]] are equivalent

![[Topological Continuous Function#Statements]]
as the following theorem shows.

## Statements

**Theorem** ([[Mendelson, B. - Introduction to Topology|@Men90, Theorem 6.3]]). Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be [[Metric Space|metric spaces]], the function $f:(X, d_X)\to (Y, d_Y)$ is a [[metrical continuous function]] if, and only, if it is a [[topological continuous function]].

## Questions

1. How are open sets defined in terms of metric?
