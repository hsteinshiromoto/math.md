# Topological Space Induced by the Metric Space

## Context

## Statements

**Theorem** ([[A Short Introduction to Metric Spaces|@Eck23, Theorem 1.2]]). Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]]. Then, $(X,d)$ is a [[topological space]], i.e., the [[Metric Open Set|metric open sets]] in $X$ satisfy the following properties:
- $X$ is open and $\emptyset$ is open.
- The union of any collection (finite or infinite) of open sets is open.
- The intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open.
